## Hey, I’m Dave

Right now, I’m working at **DataOn** as a **Implementation Consultant - Junior** — where I get to mix problem-solving, tech, and a bit of creativity every day. At the same time, I’m also continuing my studies, currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Information Systems**.  


> Still in progress, but I see it as part of the journey — sharpening both the way I think and the way I build. 


### When it comes to coding, my main toolkit includes:  


- **PHP (Laravel)** → my go-to for building solid web apps  

- **Go** → simple, fast, and fun to use for backend stuff  

- **JavaScript** (plus React + Tailwind) → I hate to say that but, I’m not good enough in FE (still learning though 😅)  

- **Python** → when I need to crunch data or automate things 

- **ColdFusion** → recently been working with it, and it’s actually kinda fun once you get the hang of it

Outside the screen? I enjoy hitting the gym 🏋️, sipping coffee ☕,  

and slowly working my way through Japanese study notes 🇯🇵 (still at N5, but I’ll get there).

I also run reality 🏃 (just capping, mate) — but for some reason, I keep getting stuck at 5 km (maybe one day I’ll break that wall).

{{< admonition quote "Quote" false >}} For me, tech isn’t just about code — it's about connecting ideas, people, and possibilities. And this little corner of the web is where I share a bit of that journey.
